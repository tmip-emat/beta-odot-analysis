# TMIP-EMAT Beta Test - ODOT

The purpose of this test and the following analysis was to 
evaluate ODOT's new Activity Based Model (ABM); specifically 
the ability of the ABM to provide information about emerging 
technologies.  To help to achieve that purpose a realistic, 
but fictitious, set of regional ABM inputs was developed.  At 
the end of this beta test, several flaws in the performance 
measure creation and methodology were noted as potential 
improvements for future analysis, but were not corrected in 
this dataset and resulting analysis.  The information in this 
data and analysis serves as an example for how to use TMIP-EMAT 
using realistic data.  This dataset and analysis should not be 
used to draw any specific conclusions about transportation 
policy's impact on system performance and outcomes.
